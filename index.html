			<font color ="Black"><p class="text-center"> One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball because when I was playing basketball game I feel that I'm strong. Most of the time I win the game but sometimes I lost the game that why I always practice and practice my self to have a good play,dribbling and shooting.My position when it comes to played basketball are small forward,shooting and point guard.Someday I want to be like Stephen Curry move because he is my one only idol and superstar in NBA league.I like the way he dribble and I like the way he shoot the ball even it is far away to basket still shoot at the ring basket. Then playing games (such as dota,SF,LOL, Counter Strike) at computer shop is one of my hobby when I'm bored.
                                  Then sometimes roadtrip because when I'm tired or some problem, I can do this to express my badly emotions etc.</p></font>
